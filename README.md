# My Own Redis

This project is a custom implementation of a Redis-like in-memory data store. It is designed to mimic the core functionalities of Redis, providing a lightweight and educational experience for understanding how Redis works under the hood.

## Features

- Key-value storage
- Basic data structures (strings, lists, sets, etc.)
- Command-line interface for interaction
- Persistence options (if implemented)
- Lightweight and easy to extend

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Language/Framework] (e.g., C++)
- [Dependencies] (e.g., GCC)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/VismayGajera112/my-own-redis.git](https://github.com/VismayGajera112/my-own-redis.git)
    cd my-own-redis
    ```

3. Run the project:
    ```bash
    g++ -std=c++11 server.cpp -o server
    g++ -std=c++11 client.cpp -o client
    ```

## Usage

2. Use the CLI to interact with the data store:
    ```bash
    g++ -std=c++11 server.cpp -o server
    g++ -std=c++11 client.cpp -o client
    ```
